This project is done by using GCP (Google Cloud Platform).
### [Process Flow](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOr7xm6I=/?share_link_id=874788083498)

### Storage
Raw data files are loaded in to Google Cloud Storage Bucket 

### Issues identified during Input Data Inspection/Validation:
1. AESTTime field has two different formats (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS)
2. AESTTime field has null values
3. Quantity filed has null values
4. NMIK4.csv is not in the list of nmi_info
5. NMIG2 is in the list but does not have a csv file 

### Data Processing:
1. Validate expected columns
2. Validate and convert data types (string to datetime)
3. Clean up invalid values and remove duplicates (if applicable)
4. Fill up null values (date based on interval, quantity default to 0, unit default to kWh)
5. Consolidate data (multiple files into one table with corresponding nmi)
